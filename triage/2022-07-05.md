# 2022-07-05 Triage Log

Overall the week is a small improvement on average, with some benchmarks
(particularly in the primary category) showing significant improvements due to
the enablement of MIR inlining in
[#91743](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/91743). Inlining promises to
improve the quality of our generated LLVM IR and make other optimizations more
worthwhile, so it's great to see these early results already being quite
impactful.

PR author notes this added a new query for each MIR body, so this is an
expected regression, and given the soundness fix is not too large to need
further investigation.

Some possibly real, though small, regressions. Unclear cause; rollup doesn't
obviously contain any sensitive PRs.

Interestingly, regressions here are remarkably similar to those in #98874
(previous rollup in this list). Not seeing an obvious connection between the PRs
in the two rollups, though.

This is *probably* noise, but it's not very clear. Regressions are minor enough
that further investigation does not seem warranted.

A fairly large improvement for some benchmarks, and particularly large for
bootstrap times (nearly 9% win). There are some fairly large regressions to a
few select benchmarks which stress the inlining more than helping LLVM (e.g.,
stm32f4), but overall this is a great improvement in many cases.

Overall an excellent, though somewhat small, improvement. Regressions are small
and limited to a couple very artificial stress tests rather than real-world
benchmarks.
