# 2022-07-12 Triage Log

A fairly noisy week (many entries below dropped and untagged as regressions),
largely driven by tt-muncher and html5ever. Our sensitivity assessment currently
takes roughly a week since new noise starts to learn the noise level, so it can
take some time for oscillations to stop reporting somewhat spurious results.

Otherwise, this week had a number of solid improvements, and was overall
positive, with improvements across many benchmarks.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

These results may partially be noise, and are overall limited enough in impact
that further investigation is not warranted at this time. Marked as triaged.

Looks to be a genuine regression, far exceeding the noise bound for the
[deeply-nested-multi benchmark][noise-graph-99047]. (This is the 4% spike on
that graph). Maybe caused by #98795, needs a little further investigation.

As noted on the PR (thanks for triaging perf regressions!), this is a limited
in magnitude and a justified regression for a soundness fix. See
this [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95295#issuecomment-1179744091) for details.

Regressions appear primarily in tt-muncher and are spurious noise; cargo and
image also show slight regressions but much smaller in comparative magnitude.
Overall a small, but solid improvement.
