# 2022-07-27 Triage Log

Overall it was a mostly good week, with some very significant wins among the
secondary benchmarks. Rollups continue to complicate triage process.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* The 4 primary regressions, 3 are helloworld check, regressing by 2.5% to 2.7% on various incr scenarios. The last is ripgrep check but that only regressed by 0.36%.
* From looking at the graph of helloworld-check over time, the regression to helloworld-check that was injected here was legitimate, as it plateaued up there for 4 or 5 days until it jumped back down due to PR [#99677](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99677)
* PR #99677 was put in to address regressions injected by PR #97786, which was rolled up in PR #98656. Looking at the data from that rollup, it appears that helloworld-check there also regressed by 2.6%; so it seems to me like the regression injected by #99520 is probably still persisting; its presence is just masked by the effect of PR #98656...
* Perhaps the regression is coming from the following queries/functions: stability_implications, metadata_decode_entry_stability_implications, defined_lib_features, metadata_decode_entry_defined_lib_features, all of which are present in the new commit but not the base commit. Were all of those added as part of PRs in this rollup?
* If the above queries are indeed to blame for the regression here, then I think that would be tied to [PR #99212](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99212), "introduce implied_by in #[unstable] attribute".
* Not marking as triaged. I'm leaving the perf-regression marker in place until we at least confirm which PR was the cause; then we can better evaluate whether the regression is an acceptable price to pay.

* Primary regressions were to clap (check full, check incr-full, and doc full), libc (doc full), hyper (check full, check incr-full, and doc full), image (doc full), and webrender (doc full).
* The significance factor points mostly to the clap cases (with 4.13x, 3.25x, and 7.15x respectively to each of the scenarios I listed above for clap).
* The [detailed query data](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?sort_idx=-11&commit=e33cc71a61c91e1d510bf283e9d345067e64eed2&base_commit=b573e10d21b69ebfadf41aa9c2f0a27919fe4480&benchmark=clap-3.1.6-check&scenario=full) for clap check full indicates that the problem is mostly in `metadata_decode_entry_item_attrs` and `visible_parent_map`; those are the ones that had a significant time delta that end up explaining the overall time delta (0.003 + 0.003 > 0.005).
* `visible_parent_map` slowdown may be due to [PR #99698](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/99698).
* The slowdown to `metadata_decode_entry_Item_attrs` may be due to [PR #99712](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/99712) ? Hard to say.
* The secondary regressions are all to the projection-caching benchmark, which regressed by 1.2% to 2.9% in various scenarios. That regression seems to be to due [a combination](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?sort_idx=-11&commit=e33cc71a61c91e1d510bf283e9d345067e64eed2&base_commit=b573e10d21b69ebfadf41aa9c2f0a27919fe4480&benchmark=projection-caching-check&scenario=full) of both the `metadata_decode_entry_item_attrs` and `visible_parent_map` regressions, as well as a little bit more time spent in `type_op_prove_predicate`, `evaluate_obligation`, and `normalize_projection_ty`. Not sure why though, I don't think those got touched by this rollup. Maybe just different execution paths from the stdlib changes that *did* come in with this rollup?
* Leaving comments on both the rollup PR and the two suspect PRs from the rollup. Not marking as triaged.

* The -20.7% improvement was to webrender-2022 (check profile, incr-patched:println scenario).
* Not quite sure which PR in the rollup yielded that kind of improvement. Maybe [PR #99486](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99486) sidestepped some pathological string construction(s) and comparison(s) in webrender?
* The primary benchmarks other than webrender all observed <1% improvement.

* 7 primary improvements, eight on diesel in check+opt full+incr-full profiles, in the range -0.31% to -0.47%; 3 primary regressions, two on diesel in debug+opt incr-unchanged, all roughly 0.23%.
* The change here was in part motivated by a soundness fix. So the relatively small regression here is easily outweighed by the soundness fix (and the fact that there were more significant improvements to boot is icing on the cake).
* marking as triaged.
