# 2022-08-02 Triage Log

A good week! We had one regression from [#99123](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99123)
that could use further study, but we had a huge swath of improvements. The downward trend of the
[performance graph summary](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=2022-07-04&end=2022-08-03&kind=percentfromfirst&stat=instructions%3Au)
is striking. Perhaps best of all: Only *one* rollup PR impacted performance this week which makes
things so much easier to evaluate! Great work everyone!

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* all 11 regressions are to various profiles+scenarios for html5ever
* @nnethercote and @eddyb are discussing the regression to html5ever on the PR (#99123)
* not marking as triaged, not yet at least; lets try and see if eddyb's suggested mitigation actually helps here

* As is, this PR registered compilation time improvements
* However, @simulacrum noted that it was associated with a nearly 2% regression to *bootstrap times*.

* wow, this was a big win! serde_derive incr-unchanged builds up to 3% faster; ripgrep check is up to 1.75% faster, hyper and webrender check 1% faster.

* This was a very *broad* win, where a huge number of benchmarks all improved by a relatively small amount. 
* I'm impressed by the [inventiveness shown during PR review](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99884#pullrequestreview-1055325175).

* the improvements are to building primary benchmark cargo opt in incr-patch: println and incr-full, by -1.38% and -0.42% respectively . The regression was to the externs incr-full in debug and opt profiles, both by 1.52%.
* this is entirely acceptable (and wasn't marked as a performance regression by the bot in the first place)
