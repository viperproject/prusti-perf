# 2022-07-19 Triage Log

A rather rough week for compiler performance with regressions outweighing improvements by a considerable margin, in particular in real world crates. To add insult to injury, the biggest regressions came in rollups which make it difficult to trace the cause.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

- Relatively small regression in secondary benchmarks. Nothing stands out as an obvious culprit, so we can mark as triaged.

- Slowdowns are happening in MIR borrow checking which this PR directly changes, so regressions are not surprising. 
- An issue should be opened to look into whether this can be improved.

- Seems the issue comes from calling an LLVM API more often due to needing to have unstable feature information kept around longer for use with the `asm!` macro. 
- Ran a cachegrind diff and found that the likely culprit is [#99155](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99155) calling `LLVMRustHasFeature` more often.

- It's very hard to tell which PR might be responsible. Luckily, there are only 5 PRs in total so it should be possible to track the issue down.

- The change seems to be localized to incremental compilation scenarios. 
- It seems queries like `incr_comp_encode_dep_graph` are being hit more often. I'm unsure whether this is simply because of the additional pass that's happening or something else.
