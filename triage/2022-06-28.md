# 2022-06-28 Triage Log

Overall, a positive week for compiler performance with regressions mainly being relegated to smaller issues. This can be see by the fact that 95 test cases in real world crates were improvements while regressions only happened in 22 test cases. The largest improvement was by @nnethercote where the compilation of `#[derive(Debug)]` was improved. This led to an average of 1% improvement in compile times across 124 real world crate test cases.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

- Given the difficulty of investigation and the relatively small magnitude of the regression, I've marked this as triaged.

- This was a high-priority correctness fix, so the regressions are acceptable at least in the short term.
- [Oli already commented](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98109#issuecomment-1165569316) on possible ideas for fixing the regression.

- [#98576](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98576) is probably the only likely candidate for this regression. 
- The cahcegrind didn't reveal anything super interesting though unfortunately.

- Some light investigation from Oli [already done](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95576#issuecomment-1161901041).
- Seems like we're spending a bit more time in trait obligation resolution
- Asked Oli whether [this is acceptable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95576#issuecomment-1168899350).

- By in large, a wash in terms of change to overall performance.
- The regressions are contained to diesel. 
- If I had to guess about a place to investigate, it would be [#87867](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97867), but it might not be worth the effort.

- The regressions are contained to only one test case (regex opt) in codegen related queries.
- I didn't find any PRs that seemed like likely culprits.
